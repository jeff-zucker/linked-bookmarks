  <li> <b>open culture</b> - everyone deserves access to ideas, information, and inspiration</li>
  <li> <b>open source</b> - software to access ideas should not be controlled by the few</li>
  <li> <b>social linked data</b> - everyone should be able to communicate, collaborate, and share in a way that preserves privacy, maximizes personal choice, and protects the public good</li>

<b>Quick Start :</b> Just start poking things in the left column. :-)

<p>
The cultural materials are from the ever-fabulous open culture sites 

<a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> and 

<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimedia Commons</a>.  

and are all available for streaming. Most are also available for download - please check the licensing information included with all sources.  Some collections, such as the Trevor Noah shows and the Ted talks are continually updated as new content is created.  
</p>
<p>
The quirky selection and categorization are based on my own personal tastes as limited by what is openly available. The goal is not to be comprehensive.  It's not an encylopedia, it's a second-hand shop filled with treasures intersperced with useles junk.  Enter if you enjoy browsing in the pre-computer sense of the term.</p> 

<p>Trigger Warning : Many of the historical materials show racist, sexist, and other biases.  I would welcome suggestions on providing greater diversity.
</p>

<p>The software is open source, based on 

<a href="https://solidproject.org/">Solid</a> 

(social linked-data), and supports distributed shared bookmarking.  Please visit the 

<a href="https://github.com/jeff-zucker/linked-bookmarks/">github repo</a> 

to get the source or provide suggestions.  This is a work in progress, collaborators welcome!.
